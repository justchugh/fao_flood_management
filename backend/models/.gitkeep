# Models Directory

This directory contains AI model files for the Flood Damage Assessment Tool.

## SAM Model Download

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is required for image segmentation.
The setup script will automatically download the model file:

- **File**: sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
- **Size**: 2.4GB
- **Source**: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth

## Manual Download

If automatic download fails, manually download:

```bash
cd backend/models
wget -O sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
```

This file is excluded from git due to its large size (.gitignore: backend/models/*.pth)
